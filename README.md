# Web Programming Project - AUT Fall 2022

This Java project, designed for the Web Programming course at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), features a web-based application to monitor URLs. It enables users to track the status of specified URLs at predetermined intervals, receive alerts upon failures, and manage their URLs efficiently.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Securely register and log in to manage URLs. Authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), providing a secure and efficient way to manage user sessions.
- **URL Monitoring**: Enter URLs to be checked at defined intervals.
- **Alerts**: Set thresholds for failure counts and receive warnings if exceeded.
- **URL Management**: Users can add, modify, or delete their tracked URLs and reset failure counts.
